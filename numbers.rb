# Numbers
# You probably already know what numbers are, so thereâ€™s no need to go into elaborate metaphors here. Ruby has all the typical math operators you would expect:

# Addition
4 + 2 + 3 + 4
# Subtraction
2 - 1 - 2
# Division
10 / 5
# Multiplication
2 * 10
# Exponentiation
2 ** 2
2 ** 6
 # Modulo
8 % 2
10 %  4
# Integers and Floats
# There are two main types of numbers in Ruby. Integers are whole numbers, such as 10. Floats are numbers that contain a decimal point, such as 10.5, 10.0, or 0.25.
17 / 5.0 
17 / 5  

# Converting Number Types
# Ruby makes it very easy to convert floats to integers and vice versa.
# To convert an integer to a float:
13.to_f   #=> 13.0

# To convert a float to an integer:
13.0.to_i #=> 13
13.9.to_i #=> 13
